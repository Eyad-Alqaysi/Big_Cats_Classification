# Big_Cats_Classification using ResNet50V2

This repository contains the code and data for a deep learning model that can accurately classify images of big cats. The model was built using the ResNet50V2 architecture and achieved a remarkable accuracy of 100%.

## Dataset 
The dataset used to train , validation and test the model contains 2,339 images of 10 different types of big cats: lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, etc. . Dataset is from kaggle url('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cats-in-the-wild-image-classification").<br>

## Instructions
To replicate the results of this project, follow these steps:

 - Clone this repository to your local machine.
 - Open the big-cats-classification_main.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, And download the Dependencies using pip install .
 - Run the code cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.
 - Once the training is complete, you can use the trained model to classify new images of big cats.
