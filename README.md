# Big_Cats_Classification using ResNet50V2

This repository contains the code and data for a deep learning model that can accurately classify images of big cats. The model was built using the ResNet50V2 architecture and achieved a remarkable accuracy of 100%.

## Dataset 
The dataset used to train, validate, and test the model consists of 2,339 images of 10 different types of big cats, including lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs, and more. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cats-in-the-wild-image-classification).<br>

## Instructions
To replicate the results of this project, follow these steps:

 1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
 2. Open the big-cats-classification_main.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab, And download the Dependencies using pip install .
 3. Run the code cells in the notebook to train the model and evaluate its performance.
 4. Once the training is complete, you can use the trained model to classify new images of big cats.
 
## Conclusion
In this project, we built a deep learning model that accurately classifies images of big cats using the ResNet50V2 architecture. This model could have potential applications in wildlife conservation, where accurate identification of big cats is essential.
